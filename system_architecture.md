# Recruitment Matching Application - System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a recruitment matching web application that uses AI to match job descriptions with candidate resumes, automate shortlisting, and schedule interviews.

## System Components

### 1. User Interface Layer
- **Recruiter Portal**: Interface for uploading JDs, viewing matched candidates, and sending interview invites
- **Candidate Portal**: Interface for uploading CVs and checking application status
- **Admin Dashboard**: For system monitoring and management

### 2. Application Layer
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and role-based access control
- **File Upload Service**: Manages JD and CV file uploads, validation, and storage
- **Matching Service**: Orchestrates the AI workflow for parsing, matching, and shortlisting
- **Notification Service**: Handles email communications for interview scheduling

### 3. AI Processing Layer
- **JD Summarizer**: Extracts key skills and requirements from job descriptions using NLP/LLM
- **CV Parser**: Converts resumes to structured data for matching
- **Matching Engine**: Computes similarity between JDs and CVs using embeddings
- **Shortlisting Algorithm**: Ranks candidates based on match percentage

### 4. Data Layer
- **User Database**: Stores user accounts, roles, and preferences
- **Document Store**: Manages uploaded JDs and CVs
- **Matching Database**: Stores matching results and candidate rankings
- **Interview Database**: Tracks scheduled interviews and status

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API / Redux
- **UI Components**: Custom components with responsive design

### Backend
- **API Framework**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 or similar cloud storage

### AI Components
- **NLP/LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4/Claude 3 for JD/CV parsing
- **Orchestration**: LangChain for AI workflow
- **Embeddings**: Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Vector Database**: (Optional) for storing and querying embeddings

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel (for Next.js application)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics

## Data Flow

1. **JD Processing Flow**:
   - Recruiter uploads JD → System stores file
   - AI summarizes JD → Extracts key skills/requirements
   - System stores structured JD data → Ready for matching

2. **CV Processing Flow**:
   - Candidate uploads CV → System stores file
   - AI parses CV → Extracts skills, experience, education
   - System stores structured CV data → Ready for matching

3. **Matching Flow**:
   - System computes embeddings for JDs and CVs
   - Matching engine calculates similarity scores
   - System ranks candidates based on match percentage
   - Shortlisting identifies candidates above threshold (e.g., ≥80%)

4. **Interview Scheduling Flow**:
   - Recruiter selects shortlisted candidate
   - System sends interview invitation email
   - Candidate confirms availability
   - System updates interview status

## Security Considerations
- Secure file upload with validation and scanning
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Role-based access control
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Scalability Considerations
- Asynchronous processing for AI tasks
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Optimized database queries
